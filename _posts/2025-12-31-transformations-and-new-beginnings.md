2025 年可能是我人生变化最大的一年。结婚、换方向、搬到美国、准备当爸爸——这些事要是分散在几年里也许还好，但都挤在这一年，真的是有点应接不暇。

<!--more-->

## 结婚

年初结婚了。婚礼办得挺简单的，没搞那些繁文缛节。来的都是真正关心的人，说了些真心话,吃了顿好饭，就这样。回头想想，这样挺好的。

结婚之后生活确实不一样了。以前一个人，做决定只考虑自己就行。现在很多事情都要商量，要考虑两个人的想法。刚开始还有点不习惯，觉得有些事情为什么要讨论这么久。慢慢发现，正是这种"一起决定"的过程，让两个人真正成为了一家人。

## 职业转向

今年最大的决定是换了方向。从之前做的图结构、infrastructure 这些，转到了算法方向。

这个决定其实纠结了挺久。之前的方向做了好几年，积累了一些东西，团队也熟悉，继续做下去应该会比较顺。但总觉得少了点什么——也许是新鲜感，也许是挑战。疫情这几年，每天都在重复差不多的事情，感觉自己在舒适区待太久了。

转到算法方向，等于是重新开始。很多东西都要从头学，很多人都要重新认识。刚开始那几个月真的很难，每天都有新问题，每天都在学新东西。开会的时候经常听不太懂大家在说什么，技术讨论也插不上话。那种感觉有点像刚毕业，既焦虑又兴奋。

现在回头看，这个决定是对的。虽然过程很辛苦，但这几个月学到的东西，可能比过去一两年都多。而且这种"不确定性"反而让人更有动力。每解决一个新问题，都会有那种久违的成就感。

## 搬到湾区

年中的时候 transfer 到了美国，在湾区开始了新的工作和生活。

说实话，决定搬过来的时候想法挺简单的——既然要换方向，不如彻底换个环境。加上考虑到以后有孩子，美国的环境可能对教育更好一些。当然，也有想看看外面世界的想法。

Landing 的过程比想象中麻烦。签证、搬家、找房子、办各种手续，每件事都要花时间。刚到的那段时间挺焦虑的，人生地不熟，连去超市买东西都要导航。慢慢适应了作息时间、交通方式、生活节奏，才算是稳定下来。

工作上倒是没有想象中那么大的变化。一开始还担心时差问题，后来发现湾区的时间和国内正好是反着的——我这边早上正好是国内晚上，我这边下午正好是国内早上。反而因为这个时差，和国内团队的配合还挺顺畅的。很多时候，国内同事下班前给我发消息，我这边起床正好可以接着处理；我这边下午的进展，又正好赶上国内早上的会议。

生活节奏其实和在国内差不多。周末也会出去走走，看看不一样的风景。最大的感受是，换个地方生活，会让你重新审视很多习以为常的事情。

## 准备当爸爸

最大的变化，应该是要当爸爸了。

得知这个消息的时候，第一反应是懵了。虽然知道结婚之后会有这一天，但真的来了还是有点不知所措。然后是紧张——我能做好一个父亲吗？我能给孩子一个好的成长环境吗？我能在工作和家庭之间平衡好吗？

准备迎接新生命的过程，也是在重新认识自己。开始想一些以前不会想的事情——什么样的教育方式更好？怎样才能给孩子安全感？怎样在保护和放手之间找到平衡？这些问题没有标准答案，但思考这些问题的过程，让我觉得自己在成长。

## 2025 总结

这一年变化太大了。结婚、换方向、搬家、准备当爸爸——每一件事单独拿出来都够折腾的，全挤在一年里，真的是累并充实着。

有焦虑的时候，担心做不好，担心选择不对。但更多的是期待——期待新的生活，期待新的挑战，期待孩子的到来。

三十多岁了，本以为生活会越来越稳定，越来越按部就班。没想到这一年比刚毕业那几年还折腾。但也正是这些变化，让人觉得还活着，还在成长。

## 展望 2026

明年孩子就要出生了。这应该是最大的事情。

工作上，希望在新方向上继续深入。算法这个领域很深，要学的东西还很多。AI 发展这么快，不进则退，得跟上节奏。

生活上，最大的挑战是平衡。工作、家庭、个人时间，怎么分配？有了孩子之后，肯定没有现在这么自由了。但这可能也是人生的一部分——学会在有限的时间里，把重要的事情做好。

博客的话，希望能多写一些。不一定都是技术文章，记录点生活、想法也挺好。多年后回头看，这些文字应该会很有意思。

2025 是转变的一年，2026 应该是适应和成长的一年。

不管怎样，往前走就对了。

## English Version

2025 was probably the year with the biggest changes in my life. Got married, switched career directions, moved to the US, and preparing to become a father—if these were spread across several years it might be manageable, but all crammed into one year has been quite overwhelming.

### Marriage

Got married early this year. The wedding was simple. No unnecessary formalities, just the people who truly care, some heartfelt words, good food, and that was it. Looking back, it was perfect that way.

Life definitely changed after marriage. When you're alone, decisions only affect yourself. Now many things need discussion, need to consider both perspectives. At first it felt a bit strange—why do we need to discuss things for so long? Gradually realized that this process of "deciding together" is what makes two people truly become a family.

### Career Pivot

The biggest decision this year was switching directions—from graph structures and infrastructure to algorithms.

This decision took a lot of deliberation. I'd spent several years in my previous direction, built up some expertise, knew the team well. Continuing would have been the safe path. But something felt missing—maybe it was the novelty, maybe the challenge. These pandemic years, every day felt repetitive. I'd been in my comfort zone too long.

Switching to algorithms meant starting over. Learning many things from scratch, meeting new people, building new connections. The first few months were really tough—new problems every day, constantly learning. Often couldn't fully follow discussions in meetings, couldn't contribute much in technical debates. It felt like being fresh out of college again—anxious yet excited.

Looking back now, it was the right call. Though the process was hard, I probably learned more in these few months than in the past couple of years. And this "uncertainty" is actually motivating. Every time I solve a new problem, there's that long-lost sense of accomplishment.

### Moving to the Bay Area

Mid-year I transferred to the US and started a new work and life in the Bay Area.

Honestly, the decision to move was pretty straightforward—if I'm going to change directions anyway, might as well change the environment completely. Plus considering having a child in the future, the US might be better for education. And of course, there was curiosity about the outside world.

The landing process was more complicated than expected. Visa, moving, finding housing, handling various procedures—everything takes time. The first few weeks were quite anxious. Unfamiliar place, even grocery shopping required GPS navigation. Gradually adapted to the schedule, transportation, pace of life, and things stabilized.

Work wasn't as different as I imagined. Initially worried about time zones, but turns out Bay Area time is perfectly opposite to China—my morning is their evening, my afternoon is their morning. Because of this time difference, collaboration with the China team actually works quite smoothly. Often Chinese colleagues send messages before they leave work, which is right when I wake up; my afternoon progress updates align perfectly with their morning meetings.

The pace of life is actually similar to China. Weekends we go out and explore different scenery. The biggest realization is that living in a different place makes you re-examine many things you took for granted.

### Preparing for Fatherhood

The biggest change is probably becoming a father.

When we got the news, my first reaction was shock. Though I knew this day would come after marriage, when it actually happened I was a bit at a loss. Then came the nervousness—can I be a good father? Can I provide a good environment for the child? Can I balance work and family?

Preparing to welcome new life is also a process of rediscovering yourself. Started thinking about things I never considered before—what kind of education is better? How to give a child security? How to find balance between protection and letting go? These questions have no standard answers, but the process of thinking through them feels like personal growth.

### 2025 Summary

Too many changes this year. Marriage, career pivot, relocation, preparing for fatherhood—each of these alone would be significant, but having them all in one year has been exhausting yet fulfilling.

There were anxious moments, worrying about not doing well, worrying about wrong choices. But mostly there's anticipation—anticipating the new life, new challenges, the baby's arrival.

In my thirties, I thought life would become more stable, more routine. Didn't expect this year to be more turbulent than the first few years after graduation. But it's exactly these changes that make you feel alive, still growing.

### Looking Ahead to 2026

Next year the baby will be born. That will be the biggest thing.

Work-wise, hoping to go deeper in the new direction. Algorithms is a deep field, still so much to learn. AI is developing so fast, can't fall behind, need to keep up.

Life-wise, the biggest challenge is balance. Work, family, personal time—how to allocate? With a child, definitely won't have the freedom we have now. But maybe that's part of life—learning to do important things well within limited time.

For the blog, hoping to write more. Not necessarily all technical posts—recording life and thoughts is good too. Years later, these words should be quite interesting to look back on.

2025 was a year of transformation. 2026 should be a year of adaptation and growth.

Either way, just keep moving forward.
