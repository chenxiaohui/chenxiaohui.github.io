## 生活的变化

回顾这几年，其实最大的变化都集中在最近一两年。前几年，尤其是疫情期间，感觉生活仿佛被按下了暂停键，每天都是机械的重复。

去年结婚了，今年即将迎来小宝宝。生活的变化从不会等你准备好，总是在不经意间悄然而至。

## 关于博客更新

很长时间没有更新博客，一半原因是工作繁忙，生活单调得似乎没什么值得记录的；另一半原因是这个博客本身——虽然效果不错，但更新起来实在太繁琐，需要配置一堆工具如 rake、ruby 等等。上次更新时还升级了 Octopress，光是处理版本兼容就花了不少时间。一想到写个博客要这么折腾，就打消了念头。

不过现在有了大模型的帮助，一切都变得简单多了。

## 2025 总结

总结一下 2025 年：最大的变化是工作换了，城市也变了。虽然生活节奏依然繁忙，工作压力丝毫未减，但感觉却与之前完全不同了，仿佛进入了另一种形式的"重复"。

## 展望 2026

展望 2026 年，希望能顺利迎接小宝宝的到来，在新的方向上有新的突破，学习到新的知识，获得更大的职业发展。

## English Version

Taking a moment to reflect on life's changes. Looking back over these years, the most significant transformations have actually occurred in the past year or two. In the years before, especially during the pandemic, life felt like it was on pause—just mechanical repetition, day after day.

Last year I got married, and this year we're expecting a baby. Life's changes never wait for you to be ready; they always arrive unexpectedly, in the quiet moments between.

### About Blog Updates

I haven't updated this blog in a long time. Half the reason was work keeping me busy and life feeling too mundane to write about. The other half was the blog itself—while it works well, updating it was such a hassle, requiring configuration of tools like rake, ruby, and so on. The last time I updated, I upgraded Octopress, and just dealing with version compatibility took considerable time. The thought of going through all that just to write a post was enough to discourage me.

But now, with the help of large language models, everything has become much simpler.

### Reflecting on 2025

The biggest change was switching jobs and relocating to a new city. Though life remains as busy as ever and work pressure hasn't lessened, it feels completely different from before—as if I've entered a new form of "repetition."

### Looking Ahead to 2026

Looking ahead to 2026, I hope to welcome our little one smoothly, make progress in new directions, learn new things, and achieve greater career development.
